After reading Uncle Bob's Clean Coder book, I decided to follow his advice to practice coding by solving simple problems over and over again. The idea is to solve the same problem and become ever better because solutions become part of muscle memory. 

To get started I copied a tool I made to organize a few thousand photo's on my phone. 

## TODO: arrange the problem/solution folders in a more meaningful way.
