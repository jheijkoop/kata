After reading Uncle Bob's Clean Coder book, I decided to follow his advice to practice coding by solving simple problems over and over again. The idea is to solve the same problem and become ever better because solutions become part of muscle memory. 

To get started I copied a tool I made to organize a few thousand photo's on my phone. 

The validate directory contains a small test utility. Each solution should create a directory structure validate/target. After running the solution code, cd into the validate folder and run
```
python acceptanceTest.py 
```
to check the result.
