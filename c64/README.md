# C64 assembly version

## Getting started

Follow instructions on [Dustlayer](http://dustlayer.com/c64-coding-tutorials/2013/2/10/dust-c64-command-line-tool)
This version of Dust tries to install Sublime 2, which has expired and won't run anymore. I've used IntelliJ instead and 
run the program from the command line:


```
dust compile
```
